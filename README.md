This site is to be used by an artist looking to promote an upcoming exhibition for their work. The design was created by Themderbolt and functions on many different devices and browsers and is fast and easy to navigate.

The layouts were created using a “mobile-up” methodology, meaning all styles were coded for a mobile device and the media queries used to change the layout as the screen size increases. This allows devices with less processing power to do minimal work when displaying the page, allowing the user to navigate the site quicker.

I used a single page scrolling script to allow the user to move to different sections in the page from the navigation menu. 

I used a few jQuery plugins to quickly implement a background slideshow as seen in the top info section as well as an image carousel to show the gallery images in the gallery section.

I integrated the Google Maps API in the location section to give the user quick access to directions using various transport methods. The map is styled to fit the overall design of the page.
